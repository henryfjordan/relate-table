# Relate Table



### TODO
```
Who knows whatI am doing? I sure as hell do not. 
Make a plan!

I need to take a snapshot of this repo and then set up a new repo from this one
consider finishing writeup?

then I need to go into my old repos and rip some code!
refactor for a while
then blamo! the tables will work?

Once I have the app working again I can do what I want
Heavy Strapi integration
First I want to build a proper content api query layer
Implement sorts ux
implement filters ux

group by? 
stop here to build out components based on column type

build out a POST/PUT/DELETE API layer
implement basic data changes

Think about content-types system for a minute, with mind towards UX
Then let your light shine and add a plus button to the end of the column headers
implement column type changes

Stop to admire a working prototype
give it some love, make it pretty

show it off
build a front page and whatnot, that's important to any project!

build out a user system, priveleges for the content-type api
get some hosting
consider domain name? - relate-table.com, relatetable.io, relatetables.com

show it off!
project done!
```
